# RC-9: Create prompt versioning structure

**Status:** closed
**Epic:** EPIC-1
**Priority:** medium

## Description

Set up a directory structure for versioned prompts to enable prompt iteration and rollback.

## Tasks

- [x] Create prompts/v1/ directory
- [x] Create researcher.md prompt
- [x] Create synthesizer.md prompt
- [x] Define clear output formats

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] prompts/v1/ exists with agent prompts
- [x] Prompts have clear structure (Role, Responsibilities, Constraints, Output Format)
- [x] Output formats are well-defined

## Notes

Created:
- prompts/v1/researcher.md - with structured output format
- prompts/v1/synthesizer.md - with synthesis output format

Versioning allows prompt iteration without losing working versions.
