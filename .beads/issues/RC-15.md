# RC-15: Implement ParallelAgent for research phase

**Status:** closed
**Epic:** EPIC-2
**Priority:** medium

## Description

Configure parallel research using ADK's ParallelAgent.

## Tasks

- [x] Import ParallelAgent from google.adk
- [x] Create research_phase with multiple researchers
- [x] Wire into orchestrator workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ParallelAgent created for research phase
- [x] Can run multiple researcher instances
- [x] Integrated into SequentialAgent workflow

## Notes

Pre-existing in orchestrator.py:
```python
research_phase = ParallelAgent(
    name="research_phase",
    agents=[researcher_agent],
)
```
Currently uses single researcher, can scale to multiple.
