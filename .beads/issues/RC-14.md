# RC-14: Build OrchestratorAgent with workflow

**Status:** closed
**Epic:** EPIC-2
**Priority:** high

## Description

Create the OrchestratorAgent that coordinates the full research workflow using ADK's SequentialAgent.

## Tasks

- [x] Create agents/orchestrator.py
- [x] Define orchestration instructions
- [x] Use SequentialAgent for workflow
- [x] Wire all specialized agents

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Orchestrator uses SequentialAgent pattern
- [x] Workflow: Research → Synthesize → Fact-Check → Write
- [x] Instructions cover query decomposition and quality standards

## Notes

Pre-existing scaffolding. Orchestrator:
- Decomposes queries into research angles
- Coordinates parallel research
- Sequences synthesis, validation, and writing
- Enforces quality standards
