# RC-18: Update agent.py entry point

**Status:** closed
**Epic:** EPIC-2
**Priority:** high

## Description

Update the main agent.py entry point to use the orchestrator instead of just the researcher.

## Tasks

- [x] Import orchestrator_agent
- [x] Set orchestrator as root_agent
- [x] Keep researcher available for direct use
- [x] Add configuration option for mode

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `adk web` starts with orchestrator
- [x] Full workflow accessible
- [x] Can still test individual agents

## Notes

Current agent.py exports researcher only. Need to upgrade to orchestrator for full workflow.
